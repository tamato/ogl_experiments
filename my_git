#the -u adds changes to existing files but does not add new files
# this is used so that the generated files in glfw & glew are not added to the repo
# a better way to do this is to look at the .getignore files for each of those directories 
# and add to my .getignore any files/dir's they missed.
#git add -u 
#git commit -m "message"
#git push -u origin master
